# ⚛️ Simple RAG - Frontend (Next.js)

Modern chat interface built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

> **Note:** For a quick start of the entire system, it is recommended to use Docker from the root folder. Read the [main README](../README.md).

## 🛠️ Local Development (Manual)

Follow these steps if you want to run **only the frontend** on your machine to modify styles or components.

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js 18+
*   npm

### Installation and Execution

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start in development mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Important:** For the frontend to work locally, you must have the backend running (either locally on port 8000 or via Docker).
